# Digitalization Impact on Economic Wealth - School Project

This is a school project prepared for the course [translate:Podstawy reprezentacji i analizy danych]. The project analyzes the influence of digitalization on the average wealth of countries using macroeconomic data. It includes exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees for classifying income groups.

I received a grade of 5 for this project.

## Project Contents
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Visualizations: boxplots, correlation matrices, scatterplots
- Machine learning models: KNN and decision trees with evaluation metrics
- Analysis of model performance and hyperparameter tuning

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset (`Dane.xlsx`) or access the original source linked in the project.
2. Run the provided Python scripts or notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
3. Review visualizations and evaluation results to understand the model behavior.

## Dependencies
- Python (version 3.8+)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
